Karma Bot is a multifaceted Discord bot developed for the [Karma Gaming](https://karma-gaming.net/) community, a gaming server of over **8,000 players**. It serves to enhance user engagement across various gaming servers and boasts a wide array of functionalities:
## User Verification
Karma Bot is equipped to link a user's Discord account with their in-game accounts through a Captcha protected website, enabling a seamless integration and data tracking across platforms.
## Ticket System
Users can create support tickets directly from Discord. These tickets are then accessible via a web interface, enhancing the customer service experience within the community.
## Moderation System
The bot incorporates message logging and a robust moderation system, facilitating community management with a warning system and various moderation commands.
## Donation Processing
Karma Bot can handle donations, deliver in-game perks to the linked accounts, and send appreciation messages, fostering a supportive community environment.
## Log Parsing and Uploading
This feature is dedicated to extracting data from game server logs on CS:GO and uploading this to a database for further storage and review.
## Economy System
Mirroring similar functionality to my other project Axishop, Karma Bot introduces an engaging gaming system where users can earn virtual money through games. The earned currency can be used to purchase items from an integrated shop, further enhancing user engagement and interaction.
