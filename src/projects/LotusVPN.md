This freelance project involved creating a custom VPN application using the .NET WPF framework to meet a client's specific design and functionality requirements. The application is tailored to integrate seamlessly with SoftEther VPN, allowing it to execute VPN-related commands through a user-friendly interface.
## Custom User Interface and Installer
Developed with WPF, the application features a custom user interface and installer, designed to match the client's aesthetic and operational specifications.
## SoftEther VPN Integration
The application interacts with the SoftEther VPN's command-line. This integration allows users to perform essential VPN actions easily and efficiently.
## Remote Configuration Capability
The client also needed access to configure the system easily and in real time, which was implemented to enhance operational flexibility.
